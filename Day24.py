#touple is a like a list but its is immutable  & it is write using () this brackets 

#ex

tup=("Akshay",210,"Male",21)
print(tup[1:3]) #---this will print (210,"Male") not (210,21) because toble create two sepracte tuple not slice

if "Akshay" in tup:
    print("yes present \n")
print(tup[1:3:2])
